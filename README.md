# 📊 Fraud Risk Overview Dashboard

This project showcases a business-ready dashboard created in **Power BI** to visualize the results of a Python-based ETL pipeline for financial fraud detection. It helps identify trends, patterns, and high-risk transactions using an easy-to-understand and interactive interface.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a professional dashboard that:
- Highlights high-risk or fraudulent transactions
- Monitors transaction behavior across different times
- Supports decision-making through risk scoring and categorization

---

## 🧪 Data Source

**File:** `cleaned_transactions.csv`  
**Generated from:** Python ETL script that:
- Extracts raw transaction data
- Transforms it with new features like `risk_score`, `high_value`, `transaction_hour`
- Loads the cleaned data into a CSV for visualization

---

## 📁 Key Features in the Dashboard

### 🔹 KPI Cards
- **Total Transactions**
- **Total High-Risk Transactions (Risk Score ≥ 4)**
- **Total Amount Processed**
- **Detected Fraud Cases**

### 🔹 Visualizations
- **Risk Score Distribution** (Bar Chart)
- **Fraud Cases Over Time** (Line Chart)
- **Transaction Type Breakdown** (Pie Chart: High Value vs Normal)
- **Detailed Transaction Table** (With conditional formatting)

### 🔹 Filters / Slicers
- Filter by `risk_score`, `high_value`, `transaction_hour`
